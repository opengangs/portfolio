## <a name = "chap0" /> Chapter 0: Field extensions
Much of our algebraic number theory studies come from the study of algebraic number fields (a concept discussed in [Chapter 1](#chap1)). However, before discussing such a concept, we revisit another concept usually taught at an undergraduate abstract algebra course (MATH3711 or MATH3521) - fields and their extensions.

To build up the concept of an _extension_, we shall look at a few examples of fields. In short, a field is some algebraic structure that allows us to add, subtract, multiply and divide elements.

**Example 0.0.1**: The set $\mathbb R$ with its standard addition and multiplication operations form a field.
