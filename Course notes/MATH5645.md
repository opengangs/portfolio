## <a name = "chap0" /> Chapter 0: Field extensions
Much of our algebraic number theory studies come from the study of algebraic number fields (a concept discussed in [Chapter 1](#chap1)). However, before discussing such a concept, we revisit another concept usually taught at an undergraduate abstract algebra course (MATH3711 or MATH3521) - fields and their extensions.

To build up the concept of an _extension_, we shall look at a few examples of fields. In short, a field is some algebraic structure that allows us to add, subtract, multiply and divide elements.

**Example 0.0.1** The set of real numbers ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\mathbb&space;R) with its standard addition and multiplication operations form a field. <br />
**Example 0.0.2** The set of natural numbers ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\mathbb&space;N) with its standard addition and multiplication operations do NOT form a field. Note that there is no notion of "subtraction" in this group. So it seems like we at least need the negative numbers. <br />
**Example 0.0.3** The set of integers ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\mathbb&space;Z) with its standard addition and multiplication operations do NOT form a field. Note that there is no notion of "division" in this ring. So even the negative and positive integers are not enough for a field. However, if we include fractions, then we do indeed form a field. <br />
**Example 0.0.4** The set of _rational numbers_ ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\mathbb&space;Q) with its standard addition and multiplication operations form a field.

### <a name = "chap01" /> 0.1 Subfields
Before we begin discussions of an extension, we also briefly discuss the notion of a _subfield_. Much like groups, there may be fields that contain other fields. For example, the field ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\mathbb&space;Q) is contained in ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\mathbb&space;R) which is contained in ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\mathbb&space;C) (with respect to the same standard addition and multiplication operations).
We formalise this concept in the following definition.

**Definition 0.0.1** Let ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?E) and ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?F) be fields with respect to the same addition and multiplication operations, and suppose that ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?E&space;\subset&space;F). Then we say that ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\mathbb&space;F) is an _extension field_ of ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?E) or equivalently ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?F&space;/&space;E) is a _field extension_.

So in the previous example, ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\mathbb&space;R) is an extension field of ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\mathbb&space;Q) and ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\mathbb&space;C) is an extension field of ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\mathbb&space;R). The reason why we call this an _extension_ is because we primarily start with a field and add some new elements to create a bigger field. This bigger field _extends_ the smaller field.

This is especially useful when we talk about polynomial reducibility. Of course, irreducibility depends on what field we talk about. For example, ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?p(x)&space;=&space;x^2&space;&plus;&space;1) is irreducible over ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\mathbb&space;R). However it can be factored into ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?p(x)&space;=&space;(x&space;&plus;&space;i)(x&space;-&space;i)) over ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\mathbb&space;C).

So one natural question is: what elements would we want to add into our field ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\mathbb&space;Q) for certain polynomials to be reducible?
